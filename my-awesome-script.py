#What : Customers have been requesting the ability to get
#notified about product updates via their WhatsApp number.
#This mode of notification is optional, but if specified, should cause
#notifications to go out both on their emails as well as WhatsApp numbers.
#
#Why : These days most people are not very frequent checking their mails, causing us a little less no of customers to be notified about our new product listings. This way we could make this number grow a little.
#
#Notes : This mode of notification is optional, but if specified, should cause
#notifications to go out both on their emails as well as WhatsApp numbers.
